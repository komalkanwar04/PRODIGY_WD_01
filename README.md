In this project, I have created a Responsive Landing Page. A responsive landing page is a web page that renders correctly on all the devices such as computers, mobile phones, tablets, or different operating systems. Having a responsive page is very important to remain accessible for all users and make the most of your opportunities.

To create a responsive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I followed these steps:
### HTML (Structure):
1. Layout Elements: Used <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer> to organize the page.
2. Content Sections: Included sections, features, testimonials, call-to-action (CTA), and contact.

### CSS (Styling):
1. Desktop-First Design: Started styling for large screens and use media queries to adjust for smaller screens.
2. Flexbox/Grid: Used CSS flexbox or grid layout for arranging elements.
3. Responsive Units: Used relative units like percentages, em, and rem for margins, paddings, and font sizes.
4. Media Queries: Adjusted layout and styles based on screen sizes (e.g., @media (min-width: 768px) for tablets and above).

### JavaScript (Interactivity):
1. Smooth Scrolling: Implemented smooth scrolling for in-page menu items.
2. Responsive Navigation: Created a navigation menu that switches to a hamburger menu on small screens.
3. Dynamic Elements: Added interactivity like image sliders, modals, or content toggles.

### Basic Understanding:
- HTML: Structures the content with semantic tags for better organization and accessibility.
- CSS: Styles the page, ensuring it looks good and is usable on different devices.
- JavaScript: Adds interactive features and enhances user experience.

This approach ensured that the landing page is visually appealing, functional, and accessible across various devices and screen sizes.
